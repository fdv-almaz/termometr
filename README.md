# Thermometer

This is a remote dual-channel thermometer that can work inside your Wi-Fi network.
It created based on a two ESP32 devices and need a WEB server and MySQL server. I have used a small home server with Linux.

Based on this system you can use unlimited number of remote displays.

Best regards,
