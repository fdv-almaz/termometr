# Thermometer

This is a remote dual-channel thermometer that can work inside your Wi-Fi network.
It created based on a two ESP32 devices and need a WEB server and MySQL server. I have used a small home server with Linux.

Based on this system you can use unlimited number of remote displays.

"board_with_sensors_data_sent_to_the_server" and "screen_to_get_temperatures_from_server_eInk" must be compiled and uploaded to the devices appropriately using ArduinoIDE with ESP32 support added.

Best regards,
